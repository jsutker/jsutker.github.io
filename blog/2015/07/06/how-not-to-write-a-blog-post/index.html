	<div class="entry-content"><p>So, you&rsquo;re writing a blog post. Good for you, you&rsquo;re putting your unique voice out into the eternal void of pain and suffering, known nowadays as the Internet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/6709/vintage-grey-airplane-plane.jpg" title="Welcome to the Internet!" width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">Pictured: the Internet</h5>


<p>If you want to write a good blog post, there are a few things you want to avoid at all costs&hellip;</p>

<h3>Research is good, distractions are not</h3>

<p>Look, I get you&rsquo;re doing your blog on Sinatra, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be going on Sinatra-based websites and playing games. You need to keep yourself focused on this blog, or else you&rsquo;re going to wake up the next day covered in the Internet, and while that may seem awesome, it&rsquo;s not. Trust me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/2740/nature-animal-fur-dangerous.jpg" title="Shame on you." width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">He's seen your browser history. Does he look amused to you?</h5>


<h3>Don&rsquo;t go with a topic because it was the first thing you thought of</h3>

<p>Spend at least a little more time coming up with something interesting! If you&rsquo;re dreading writing the blog post, your users will dread reading it. Make it interesting, or people will take out every device they own and shut them off just to know for <em>sure</em> that your blog isn&rsquo;t open on any of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="http://s28.postimg.org/edv2lqpdp/PS2_Test_Blackscreen.png" title="So interesting." width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">Look at all of the things that are less interesting than your post.</h5>


<p>If you write about a topic that you don&rsquo;t care about, you&rsquo;re basically saying to your readers, &ldquo;Haha, screw you! I hate you so much that I&rsquo;m putting myself through mental and emotional pain just to bring you this boring content! Take that!&rdquo; Seriously, why would you say that? You must really be a jerk.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t assume things about your readers</h3>

<p>You know what you&rsquo;re doing. Stop that.</p>

<h3>Avoid making the title of a section way longer than it needs to be, even if you can&rsquo;t figure out how to end the title because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s, like, really hard, man&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Yeah,&hellip; that.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t make the content too short</h3>

<p>Especially for three sections in a row.</p>

<h3>Be consistent</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/6389/hand-vintage-old-book.jpg" title='"Huh, so this is the Internet."' width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">"Where are all the pictures?"</h5>


<h3>Watch out for spelling mistakes</h3>

<p>Just like in code, a spelling mistake can ruin an entire blog pots.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t end it too abruptly</h3>

<p>Especially avoid ending it in the middle of a word or sentence.</p>

<h3>And most importantly, avoi</h3>
