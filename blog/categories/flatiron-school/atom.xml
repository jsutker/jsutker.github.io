    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, you&rsquo;re writing a blog post. Good for you, you&rsquo;re putting your unique voice out into the eternal void of pain and suffering, known nowadays as the Internet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/6709/vintage-grey-airplane-plane.jpg" title="Welcome to the Internet!" width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">Pictured: the Internet</h5>


<p>If you want to write a good blog post, there are a few things you want to avoid at all costs&hellip;</p>

<h3>Research is good, distractions are not</h3>

<p>Look, I get you&rsquo;re doing your blog on Sinatra, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be going on Sinatra-based websites and playing games. You need to keep yourself focused on this blog, or else you&rsquo;re going to wake up the next day covered in the Internet, and while that may seem awesome, it&rsquo;s not. Trust me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/2740/nature-animal-fur-dangerous.jpg" title="Shame on you." width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">He's seen your browser history. Does he look amused to you?</h5>


<h3>Don&rsquo;t go with a topic because it was the first thing you thought of</h3>

<p>Spend at least a little more time coming up with something interesting! If you&rsquo;re dreading writing the blog post, your users will dread reading it. Make it interesting, or people will take out every device they own and shut them off just to know for <em>sure</em> that your blog isn&rsquo;t open on any of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="http://s28.postimg.org/edv2lqpdp/PS2_Test_Blackscreen.png" title="So interesting." width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">Look at all of the things that are less interesting than your post.</h5>


<p>If you write about a topic that you don&rsquo;t care about, you&rsquo;re basically saying to your readers, &ldquo;Haha, screw you! I hate you so much that I&rsquo;m putting myself through mental and emotional pain just to bring you this boring content! Take that!&rdquo; Seriously, why would you say that? You must really be a jerk.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t assume things about your readers</h3>

<p>You know what you&rsquo;re doing. Stop that.</p>

<h3>Avoid making the title of a section way longer than it needs to be, even if you can&rsquo;t figure out how to end the title because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s, like, really hard, man&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Yeah,&hellip; that.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t make the content too short</h3>

<p>Especially for three sections in a row.</p>

<h3>Be consistent</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div width="50%" align="center"><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/6389/hand-vintage-old-book.jpg" title='"Huh, so this is the Internet."' width="50%"></div>


<h5 align="center">"Where are all the pictures?"</h5>


<h3>Watch out for spelling mistakes</h3>

<p>Just like in code, a spelling mistake can ruin an entire blog pots.</p>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t end it too abruptly</h3>

<p>Especially avoid ending it in the middle of a word or sentence.</p>

<h3>And most importantly, avoi</h3>

    <link href="http://jsutker.github.io/blog/2015/06/15/%7C%7C-awesome-operators-are-awesome/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-15T09:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jsutker.github.io/blog/2015/06/15/||-awesome-operators-are-awesome</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>||=</h1>

<p>Or-equals, pipe-pipe-equals, double-pipe-equals, whatever you want to call it, this thing is awesome. Let me tell you why.</p>

<h3>Why It&rsquo;s Awesome:</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re writing some code. It&rsquo;s some pretty damn good code, but you have this variable that might be set to something, it might not. What&rsquo;re you gonna do? You&rsquo;re gonna use ||=, that&rsquo;s what.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">if 2 &gt; 3
  puts "You get to input something!"
  statement = gets.chomp
else
  puts "You don't get to input anything!"
end
statement ||= "This is a default statement."
statement
#=&gt; "This is a default statement."
</code></pre>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that awesome? You&rsquo;re damn right it was awesome.</p>

<hr />

<h1>defined?</h1>

<p>This one is simple, it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;defined?&rdquo;. No ambiguity there. I bet you can guess what it does.</p>

<h3>Why It&rsquo;s Awesome:</h3>

<p>Just in case you weren&rsquo;t convinced by ||=, this bad boy checks if your variable is defined. If not, it doesn&rsquo;t throw a hissy-fit, it&rsquo;s just like &ldquo;Nah man, this thing doesn&rsquo;t exist, so I&rsquo;m gonna throw you a nil.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a bro.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">example1 = 7
def example2
end
$example3 = true
defined? example1 #=&gt; "local-variable"
defined? example2 #=&gt; "method"
defined? $example3 #=&gt; "global-variable"
defined? example4 #=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>That was pretty awesome. But that&rsquo;s not all it can do. You can use it in a method as well.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">def example5
  defined? yield
end
class example6
  include Enumerable
  def count
    defined? super
  end
end
example5 {|a| a} #=&gt; "yield"
example6.count #=&gt; "super"
</code></pre>

<p>That was pretty damn awesome.</p>

<hr />

<h1>&lt;=></h1>

<p>This is our last awesome operator for this post. It looks like the intense hybrid of less-than-or-equal-to, greater-than-or-equal-to, and a TIE Fighter. That in and of itself is awesome, but it gets better.</p>

<h3>Why It&rsquo;s Awesome:</h3>

<p>So which comparison do we want to use for two different pieces of data, less-than, equals, or greater-than? Yes.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">a = 2
b = 1
a &lt;=&gt; b #=&gt; -1
b &lt;=&gt; a #=&gt; 1
a &lt;=&gt; a #=&gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>See that? If the first one&rsquo;s bigger, it gives you -1. If the second one&rsquo;s bigger, it gives you 1. They&rsquo;re the same? You get 0, because of course you do.</p>

<hr />

<p>Are these operators awesome? Yes.
Am I overreacting to how awesome they are? Probably.</p>

    <link href="http://jsutker.github.io/blog/2015/06/09/variable-scope-an-analogy/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-09T08:39:10-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://jsutker.github.io/blog/2015/06/09/variable-scope-an-analogy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During a lecture, there was a discussion on variable scope, which sparked an idea for an analogy. Picture this:</p>

<p>Welcome to Rubyland, land of many things. In Rubyland, there are castles (methods) and there are pits (blocks). Whenever a knight (variable) comes into being, he is given a weapon (value), tied down to where he was created by a giant rope.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a knight outside of all of the castles and pits, in the main part of Rubyland. We&rsquo;ll call him sir_variable. Our knight, sir_variable, can&rsquo;t get over the walls of the castle, so nobody there knows he exists (but none of the knights from the castle can get out either, so it&rsquo;s fair). He could easily jump into pits, exchange his sword for a handy new battleaxe if he so pleases, and climb up his rope right out.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s create another knight, sir_reference. He was created in a pit, where he&rsquo;s been fighting hashes and going on quests. No matter what, he doesn&rsquo;t have a rope to climb that could bring him up and out of the pit, because his rope is all in the pit.</p>

<p>And that is how variable scope works. So remember kids, always keep your variables in scope, or you might find yourself in a battle without a weapon.</p>
